# Parking-Garage-Project
Parking Garage System is a fault-tolerant distributed system where cars are taken as client and lot are server space. When a client tries to park his/her car in the parking lot, the system will show the available parking lot by which user can park in the empty lot. Parking Garage System plays an important role when any failure occurs.  The main goal is to design and implement an automated distributed parking lot management system that satisfies requirements discussed in section 2 of this report. Based on these requirements, it is a fully functional and digitally controlled parking garage system that is implemented with the use and integration of different distributed computing mechanisms. Basically, this system has been implemented in order to achieve our course learning objectives of COSC 5302 Advanced Operating System.
